# ESP32 - ESPHome Projekt
This repository contains all files that I used to create my smarthome sensors in my house. A detailed description of the project can be found on my [blog page](https://blog.altholtmann.com/?p=1404).

## ESP32 breakout
The `esp32 breakout` folder contains a general purpose breakout board for the esp32. I have included all files for ordering the pcbs for example at [JLCPCB](www.jlcpcb.com). I have also included a din rail mount that fits exactly the pcb holes.

## Wall socket multi sensor
The `wall socket` folder contains all files to produce the multisensor pcbs for example at at [JLCPCB](www.jlcpcb.com). Also I have included the stl and fusion360 files for the case that I have created for it.

Feel free to use/clone/fork/edit this project.
